This is a project and presentation using topic modeling (LDA modeling with the Gensim package) and geospatial analysis to analyze conversations between attorneys and clients in an online service where clients can request legal consulting. The goal was to analyze the details of the conversations, including the text, timestamps, and locations to develop strategies to improve the service and present them to stakeholders. In particular, we analyzed what specific topics of conversation drove lower attorney response rates, one of the biggest areas of the legal service in need of improvement. The **[presentation](https://github.com/tdewing19/legal-topic-modeling/blob/main/DataFest_2023_Submission.pdf)** contains our findings with corresponding data visualizations.
